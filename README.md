Plotting Datafiles on python using matplotlib, pandas and plotly  

### Why Plotting is so important

Data file plotting sits at the heart of scientific research. To represent data in plots is a little bit chalenging if you don't have proper tools. After plotting comes the question of aesthetics. The plots must have to look beautiful as well as should be represented in a tangible way. So, in this initiative I'll try to upload many exampls so that people who are interested can educate themselves.

In this repo I have mainly considered using python for plotting . Python provides a very flexible environment and has all the tools for plotting. Python makes your plots beautiful. On top of it few libraries such as **matplotlib** , **pandas** , **plotly** are used to produce masterpiece plots.
